            <h3>The Journey Begins</h3>     
       
            <p>In July of 2019, I moved from Los Angeles, California to St. Louis. I had most of my stuff shipped, so it should've been a nice little road trip, right? Wrong. You see, I had two cats in the car with me. Usually they were the best of friends, and when I'd driven them somewhere locally together, they'd freak out about being separated in the car. So I bought a (very expensive) soft-sided crate-thing to put both of them in together. <em>Since they love each other so much.</em></p>

            <h3>One Hour In</h3>
            <p>After a series of events pushing back our departure time, we were finally on the road. We hadn't even hit the Inland Empire before my older cat got carsick. And by carsick, I mean he pooped. A lot. All over himself. And then pushed Oscar Wild into it, so he was also covered in poop. I parked in the lot of a big box store, and with baby wipes and the roll of paper towels I'd luckily packed, cleaned them (and the crate) up as best I could. But the car smelled terrible all the way to northwest Arizona. At 2 in the morning I was shoving the cats into the bathtub of a Motel 6 bathroom, washing them with shampoo, and then washing the blanket that had been in the crate - their favorite blanket that had been gifted to me by a student... otherwise I would have thrown it out. </p>

            <h3>New Friends</h3> 
            <p>The next day, in the 95-degree heat, I had the joy of taking them, in the crate, inside a Walgreens to buy a replacement towel for the crate, along with more cleaning supplies. The cashiers let me leave them up front, and I could hear people talking to the cats <em>the entire time I was in the store.</em> Every single customer greeted them. Every employee stopped by to coo at them. </p>
        
            
            <h3>In Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="fancy-font">I'm really glad everyone else enjoyed my shitty cats that day, because I sure didn't. </p>
